# CityOfHopeVolunteerTracking

This project is aimed at creating a volunteer hours tracking software for the local nonprofit [City Of Hope](https://www.coho58.org). 

Users will be able to clock in their hours and view reports of their hours, and admins will be able to view hours logs of all users and calculate government grants for hours volunteered.
